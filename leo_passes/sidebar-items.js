See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form for more information. The pass also flattens `ConditionalStatement`s into a sequence of `AssignStatement`s. The pass also rewrites `ReturnStatement`s into `AssignStatement`s and consolidates the returned values as a single `ReturnStatement` at the end of the function. The pass also simplifies complex expressions into a sequence of `AssignStatement`s. For example, `(a + b) * c` is rewritten into `$var$1 = a + b; $var$2 = $var$1 * c`."],["symbol_table",""],["type_checking",""]]};
